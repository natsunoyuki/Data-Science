# resale-flat-prices

Project Description:
This project was done with advice from a real estate company in Tokyo.
The aim of this project is to analyze the resale flat prices
in Singapore, and to build a model which is capable of accurately
predicting resale flat prices in Singapore.
The data used in this project is available from the Singapore gov. homepage:
https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices

This project is a technology demonstrator used to showcase the capabilities
of machine learning technology to the real estate industry, and aims to be
easily explainable by a non-expert rather than using the latest technology or
"hard to understand" analytical/modelling methods.
