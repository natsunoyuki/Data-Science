"""
Post-analysis comments: 
It would seem that the logistic growth rate is k = 0.224 per day,
the sigmoid midpoint is x0 = 24 days
and the total population is L = 81072.
China's population is 1.386E9 people. The 5 most affected regions were
Henan with 94E6 people, Hubei with 58.5E6 people, Hunan with 67.37E6 people
Guangdong with 113.46E6 people and Zhejiang with 57.37E6 people.
The total population of these 5 regions is 390700000 people.
This means that this point of time, the total rate of transmission is roughly
0.0002. This should allow us to estimate the value of L.

Case 1: California with population of 39.56E6 people:
L = 0.0002 * 39.56E6 = 8000 people approx.
Case 2: USA with population of 327.2E6 people:
L = 0.0002 * 327.2E6 = 65000 people approx.
Case 3: Japan with population of 126.8E6 people:
L = 0.0002 * 126.8E6 = 25000 people approx.
